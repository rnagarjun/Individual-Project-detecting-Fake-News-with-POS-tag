# Project Info

This project contains couple of Machine Learning Algorithms
Both implemented from scratch and ones using SciKit learn library to try and see if is POS tags can be used to successfully classify an news article as authentic or not.

## Installation

1. Make sure python3 is download
2. Creating a Virtual Environment by the following command.
	$virtualenv -p locationOfPython3 nameOfVirtualEnv
	Example
	$virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 myVirtualEnv
3. Activating the virtual environment
	$. MLVirenv/bin/activate
4. Installing all dependencies
From the root location of the file
	$pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
To run any one of the program
	$python processName.py

	There are 4 process 
		ML_SciKitLearn.py
		my_naive_bayes.py
		my_logistic_regression.py
		my_cross_validation.py
		For specific implementation details see the appropriate section in the documentation.
